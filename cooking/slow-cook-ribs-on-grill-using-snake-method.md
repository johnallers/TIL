# Attempt at slow cooking ribs on a kettle grill using the charcoal snake method.

## 0720 Hours - Grill prep

* Lit the starter coals.
* Heated up some water for the pan.
* Arranged the charcoal and wood chips.

## 0745 Hours - Preheat

* Added the starter coals.
* Added a pan with hot water.
* Covered the grill and waited for it to get to a good temperature (225-275 degrees F).

* Grill was around 220 degrees.

## 0946 Hours - Too hot!

* Grill was at 290 degrees. Close the intake vent to about 25%.

## 1200 Hours - Basting time

* Checked and basted the ribs.
* About 85% of the charcoals on the bottom row were already started. Is it burning too fast?

## Lessons Learned / Things to try differently next time

* Allow more time for the starter coals to get hot.

I was in a rush and needed to get my daughter to school, but wanted to get the ribs on the grill first. The starter coals could have used more time to heat up.

* Leave the exhaust vent fully open and regulate the temperature using intake vent.

I tried adjusting both at various times to get the temperature where I wanted, but in the end I don't know what settings really worked. Next time keep it simple and only adjust one.

* Use a longer snake.

I arranged the snake to go halfway around the grill hoping that it would last 8 hours, but it only lasted 6 1/2. It was awkward trying to add more coals at that point. Make the snake longer, just in case.

* Orient the grate to easily allow more charcoal to be added, if necessary.

The grate on my grill opens up on two sides, but I had place the ribs in a position that made it awkward for opening. Orient the grate and the meat so that the grate can be opened and dropped in without any fuss.
